 ## Enumerations
 An enumeration is defined using the `enum` keyword and they define a common type for a group of related values. For example, given that there are seven colors in the rainbow you could create a enumeration named `ColorsOfRainbow` and add the seven colors as possible values. Enumerations are useful whenever you find yourself with an `if-else` ladder.

 Enumeration names are written with `UpperCamelCase`. The enumeration cases are written with smallCamelCase. This is best practice.
 
    enum ColorsOfRainbow {
        case red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet
    }
    
    let yellowColor = ColorsOfRainbow.yellow
 
 Enumerations can come with prepopulated values. These are known as **raw values** and these should all be of the same type. When you define an enumeration to have a integer or string values you do not need to explicitly assign a raw value for each case becuase Swift will do this automatically for you.
 
     enum ColorsOfRainbow: String {
         case red = "Red color", orange = "Orange color", yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet
     }
    
     let redColor: ColorsOfRainbow = .red
     print(redColor.rawValue)
 
     let greenColor: ColorsOfRainbow = .green
     print(greenColor.rawValue)
 
 Enumerations are usually used with the **switch statement**. This allows us to match individual enumeration cases. A switch statement must be exhaustive meaning it should cover every possible case in an enumeration. However, you only need to cover a few enumeration cases if you create a default case in your switch statement.
 
     enum ColorsOfRainbow {
         case red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet
     }
 
     let violetColor = ColorsOfRainbow.violet
        
     switch violetColor {
        case .red:
            print("This will not print")
        case .orange:
            print("This will not print")
        case .yellow:
            print("This will not print")
        case .green:
            print("This will not print")
        case .blue:
            print("This will not print")
        case .indigo:
            print("This will not print")
        case .violet:
            print("This WILL print!!")
     }
 
 The keywords `break` and `fallthrough` are control flow statements used with enumerations (we learn about control flow statements in our lesson on Control Flow). `break` causes a switch statement to end its execution immediately and to transfer control to the code after a switch's closing brace (}). `fallthrough` will make a switch statement to fall into the next case.
 
 As of Swift 5, switch statements are able to handle future unknown enum cases. This change only applies to system defined enums therefore this does not affect our user defined enums.
