 This Playground will be your way of both practising the concepts we are about to learn and as a reference. You are not expected to cram what we learn but to come back and revisit the notes and examples to refresh your memory.
 
 We focus a lot on best practice and proper coding technique. I will make no adjustments to coding terminology to make things easier to understand in the spirit of the Swift API Design principle **Embrace Precedent** which specifically states, **"Donâ€™t optimize terms for the total beginner at the expense of conformance to existing culture"**. At the same time, I wish to make what we learn as easy and effortless as possible. Therefore, my approach to teaching will be one where I use a lot of detail, metaphors and examples.
 
 Please remember that practice is what promotes understanding. Therefore, code along with me in the videos. If you are already knowledgable of Swift you are free to skim the videos and focus on what is interesting to you.
 
 ## Useful Terms
 * **Programming** giving a computer instructions.
 * **High Level Programming Language** a programming language that is written in a way that is easily understandable and close to human language. Swift is a high level language.
 * **Low Level Language** a programming language written to be optimized for machines to understand. In the background, high level languages are converted to low level machine code in a process called building or compiling.
 * **Syntax** the structure of statements in a computer language.
 * **Semantics** the meaning behind the actual code we write (N.B this has a deeper meaning in Computer Science).
