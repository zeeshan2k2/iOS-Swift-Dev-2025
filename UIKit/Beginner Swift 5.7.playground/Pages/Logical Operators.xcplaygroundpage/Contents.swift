 ## Logical Operators
 
 ![diagram](diagram.png)
 
 Logical operators either modify or combine Boolean logic values `true` or `false`. Swift supports three logical operators:
 * **NOT** (!a) Inverts a Boolean value so that `true` becomes `false` and `false` becomes `true`.
 * **AND** (a && b) Creates a logical expression where both values need to be `true` for the overall experession to be `true`.
 * **OR** (a || b) Creates a logical expression where just one of the two values has to be `true` for the overall expression to be `true`.

    let paulAge = 19
    let janeAge = 25
    if paulAge < janeAge && paulAge != janeAge {
        print("This will print because paulAge is less than janeAge and paulAge is not equal to janeAge")
    }
 ```

if paulAge > 18 && janeAge > 20 {
    print("Both are adults")
} else {
    print("Both are not adults")
