 ## Protocols
 A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties and other requirements that adopting classes, structures or enumerations must conform to. Protocols do not implement any functionlaity themselves but become fully-fledged types when used.
 
 When specifying the property requirements of a protocol all properties must be declared as variables. A protocol requires that a property is declared as gettable or settable which allows for a lot of flexibility in making the actual property a stored or computed property.
 
 When specifying the method requirements of a protocol all you need is the method name but without the curly braces.
