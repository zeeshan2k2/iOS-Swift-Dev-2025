 ## Object Oriented Programming
 Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming concept based on building an app on objects. It is meant to make our apps easier to manage, develop and maintain.
 
 There are four main aspects of OOP:
 1. **Encapsulation** this is hiding the internal state or data of objects. Only the object that 'owns' the data can change its content. Other objects can only access or modify this data by sending messages.
 2. **Abstraction** is hiding all but relevant data about an object.
 3. **Inheritance** this means the objects of one class can derive its behaviour from another class and tailor that behaviour to suit its needs.
 4. **Polymorphism** this allows different objects that share a common interface to behave in their own way.
 
 *As a special note, inheritance is described as an **is-a** relationship. Composition is where an instance of a class or structure exists as a field in your class and this is described as a **has-a** relationship.*
 
 OOP should adhere to the SOLID principles which are:
 * Single responsibility principle
 * Open-closed principle
 * Liskov substitution principle
 * Interface segregation principle
 * Dependency inversion principle
