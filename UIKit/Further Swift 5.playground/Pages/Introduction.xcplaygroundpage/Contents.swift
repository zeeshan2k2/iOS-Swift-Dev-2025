 This part of the course takes us further from beginner Swift 5 into more intermediate concepts. We were limited to an imperative or a procedural style of writing code. This of course is not how real iOS apps are written. Whilst simple, imperative programming is not suited to dealing with the complexity of building an app with alot of code and it is not how Apple has written its API and frameworks.
 
 The root of what we are about to learn is building code that is easy to maintain, reusable and manageable. At the heart of this are classes and structures. This opens the world to Object Oriented Programming and Protocol Oriented Programming which are better suited to dealing with complexity.
 
 Learning this part of the course is essential. Eventually, we will meet design patterns that originate from these styles of writing code. For example, `Delegation` is a design pattern that requires knowledge of Protocol Oriented Programming.
 
 ### Useful Terms
 
 **DRY** this is an acronym for Don't Repeat Yourself. We will encounter this principle alot as we move throughout this course.
