 ## Named Types
 A named type is a user defined type. `Integers`, `Doubles` and `Strings` are named types but these have been defined for us by Swift. We have the ability to create our own named types with `Structures`, `Classes` and `Enumerations`.
 
 `Structures` and `Classes` describe or model *'something'*. For example, we could use a `Structure` to describe to describe a possible user in our app. `Structures` or `Classes` do not actually represent an actual *'thing'*. They are just blueprints with the specifications of what that *'thing'* might look like. So we could have a `Structure` that describes a `User`. This is just a blueprint of a `User`. To create an actual `User` we need to create an **instance** of a `User` from the structure.
 
 `Structures` and `Classes` are made up of related properties and methods. The methods describe the behaviour or functionality of the `Structure` or `Class`. The properties describe the data members of the `Structure` or `Class`. Therefore, a structure called `User` could have properties like name, age and password. The same structure could have methods like changePassword and saveProfile.
 
 ### Important Definitions
 
 * `self` is a special property of an instance that holds the instance itself.
 * `Any` can represent an instance of a class, structures, enumerations or any type at all.
 * `AnyObject` can represent an instance of any class type (therefore types like structures and enumerations are excluded).

struct User {
    
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var password: String
    
    func changeName() {
        
    }
}


var firstUser: User = User(name: "Zeeshan", age: 23, password: "abc123")

print(firstUser.name)



class Car {
    var name = "Toyota"
    
    func changeName(_ name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

let car = Car()
